          <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
          <p>
            After several years working in HR, I decided to pursue my passion
            for coding and made the switch to software engineering. I've since
            developed a strong skill set in several programming languages,
            including Ruby, JavaScript, and Java, which I use to design and
            implement effective and user-friendly software solutions. I'm
            passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends and
            technologies in the industry, and I'm always seeking new challenges
            to help me grow and improve as a software engineer.

            Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio, and please
            feel free to contact me with any questions or opportunities!

          <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
          <p>
            Gaming: As a software engineer, I'm naturally drawn to the world of
            technology, and one of my favorite ways to explore it is through
            gaming. I love the immersive worlds, intricate storylines, and
            challenging puzzles that video games offer. But beyond that, I also
            appreciate the social aspect of gaming - whether I'm playing with
            friends or participating in an online community, there's always the
            opportunity to connect with other like-minded individuals and share
            experiences. For me, gaming is a way to unwind, stimulate my mind,
            and connect with others, all at the same time.
          </p>

            Reading: When I'm not coding or gaming, you can often find me curled
            up with a good book. I've always been a bookworm, and I find that
            reading is a great way to relax and escape into other worlds and
            perspectives. Whether I'm delving into a gripping thriller or
            immersing myself in a thought-provoking work of non-fiction, I
            always come away from my reading with new insights and ideas.
            Reading also helps me stay sharp and informed about developments in
            the world of technology and beyond, which is essential in my work as
            a software engineer.
