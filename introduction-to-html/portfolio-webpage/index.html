      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        After several years working in HR, I decided to pursue my passion for
        coding and made the switch to software engineering. I've since developed
        a strong skill set in several programming languages, including Ruby,
        JavaScript, and Java, which I use to design and implement effective and
        user-friendly software solutions. I'm passionate about staying
        up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry, and
        I'm always seeking new challenges to help me grow and improve as a
        software engineer.
