            Pappardella is the culmination of Tom and Jerry’s long held dream to
            open a pasta bar serving fresh, hand rolled pasta with delicious
            sauces and fillings inspired by their trips to Italy. Choose from a
            variety of pasta shapes, including spaghetti, fettuccine, and
            gnocchi, all made by hand daily. Our sauces range from classic
            tomato and basil to more adventurous options like truffle cream and
            wild mushroom. We also offer a range of delicious fillings, such as
            spinach and ricotta or slow-cooked beef ragù.<br />
            Our menu is designed to cater to all tastes and dietary
            requirements, with gluten-free and vegetarian options available.
            Pair your pasta with a carefully curated wine selection from Italy
            or a refreshing cocktail.
