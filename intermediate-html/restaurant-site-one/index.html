            Papardella is the culmination of Tom and Jerry’s long held dream to 
            open a pasta bar serving fresh, hand rolled pasta with delicious 
            sauces and fillings inspired by their trips to Italy. Choose from a variety 
            of pasta shapes, including spaghetti, fettuccine, and gnocchi, all made by hand 
            daily. Our sauces range from classic tomato and basil to more adventurous 
            options like truffle cream and wild mushroom. We also offer a range of 
            delicious fillings, such as spinach and ricotta or slow-cooked beef ragù.<br>
            Our menu is designed to cater to all tastes and dietary requirements, with 
            gluten-free and vegetarian options available. Pair your pasta with a carefully 
            curated wine selection from Italy or a refreshing cocktail.
