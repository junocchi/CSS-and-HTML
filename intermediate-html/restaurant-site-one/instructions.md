Check Your Work
Use the list below to make sure you included all the required components in your website.

Home page: Restaurant Information
The home page includes the name of the restaurant, the restaurant's address and phone number, and a picture that represents the restaurant.

Home page: Page Layout
The page layout reasonably matches the provided wireframe, including the appropriate tab name, main heading, navigation pane, image, description, and footer.

Home page: Picture
The home page includes an appropriate photo of a restaurant and the image is sized and positioned correctly on the page.

Menu Page: Page Contents
The menu page includes a tab name, the restaurant name, and at least six food items, including a name, description, and price for each item.

Menu Page: Layout
The layout of the menu page reasonably matches the layout shown in the wireframe.
Contact Us Page: Layout
The layout of the Contact Us page reasonably matches the layout shown in the wireframe.
Contact Us Page: Form Elements
Each of the form elements is defined correctly, including the drop-down list and the button.

Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks work as expected. Internal hyperlinks should open in the current window and external hyperlinks should open in a new tab or window.

File Management
Files and folders use appropriate naming conventions. All HTML files are in the website's root folder, and the image file is in an appropriate subfolder.

Concepts
I can explain to someone else who knows HTML how I used HTML elements to structure the page contents, including especially the use of semantic elements.

Code Style
The code is formatted so that it is easy for other developers to read, including appropriate line breaks and indents. Appropriate comments are included.
